# Steering Rules

This directory contains steering rules that guide development of this project.

## Active Steering Rules

1. **00-serena-bootstrap.md** - Serena MCP tool initialization (always)
2. **01-task-completion-requirements.md** - Task completion criteria (always)
3. **02-naming-conventions.md** - Brand-agnostic naming and Go conventions (always)
4. **03-go-best-practices.md** - Go language best practices (always)
5. **04-incremental-development-discipline.md** - Incremental development discipline (always)

## Rule Priority

All rules marked `inclusion: always` are active for every conversation.

## Key Principles

- **Incremental Development**: Build task-by-task with mandatory quality gates
- **Brand Agnostic Code**: No project name in function/struct names
- **Go Idioms**: Follow standard Go conventions
- **Working Code**: Functional at every step, not theoretical architecture
- **Simple First**: Avoid premature optimization and abstraction
- **Library Quality**: High test coverage, clear docs, backward compatibility

## For AI Assistants

Read these rules at the start of each conversation to understand:
- How to use Serena tools effectively
- What constitutes task completion
- Naming conventions to follow
- Go best practices to apply
- Phase gate discipline to maintain

## For Developers

These rules ensure:
- Consistent code style
- Proper task completion
- Incremental progress
- Quality gates at each task
- Maintainable, idiomatic Go code
- Production-ready library quality
